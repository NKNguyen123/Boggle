# Boggle
A game of Boggle I made in Python for fun, you can play it on your terminal.

HI! Welcome to Boggle, a fun and simple word game.

# How to run:

In order to play, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the Boggle folder, once there simply enter "python Boggle.py"

# How to play:

Form words from the grid by connecting adjacent or diagonal letters.

Enter the word when prompted and the machine will tell you if it's valid.

Here are the rules for valid words:

-Words must be at least 3 letters long

-You cannot repeat slots that have already been used for that word, like so:

PO

O

"POOP" would be invalid in the example above because you'd be reusing the same "P"

-You cannot repeat words

-The longer a word is, the more points it's worth!
